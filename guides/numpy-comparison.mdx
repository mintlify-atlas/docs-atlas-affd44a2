title: Conversion to NumPy and Other Frameworks
description: Learn how to convert MLX arrays to and from NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow using the Python Buffer Protocol and DLPack
---

MLX array supports conversion between other frameworks with either:

- The [Python Buffer Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html)
- [DLPack](https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/)

## NumPy

Let's convert an array to NumPy and back:

```python
import mlx.core as mx
import numpy as np

a = mx.arange(3)
b = np.array(a)  # copy of a
c = mx.array(b)  # copy of b
```

<Note>
Since NumPy does not support `bfloat16` arrays, you will need to convert to `float16` or `float32` first:

```python
np.array(a.astype(mx.float32))
```

Otherwise, you will receive an error like: `Item size 2 for PEP 3118 buffer format string does not match the dtype V item size 0.`
</Note>

### Creating Array Views

By default, NumPy copies data to a new array. This can be prevented by creating an array view:

```python
a = mx.arange(3)
a_view = np.array(a, copy=False)
print(a_view.flags.owndata)  # False
a_view[0] = 1
print(a[0].item())  # 1
```

<Note>
NumPy arrays with type `float64` will be default converted to MLX arrays with type `float32`.
</Note>

A NumPy array view is a normal NumPy array, except that it does not own its memory. This means writing to the view is reflected in the original array.

### Gradient Considerations

<Warning>
While array views are powerful for preventing copies, external changes to the memory of arrays cannot be reflected in gradients.
</Warning>

Let's demonstrate this in an example:

```python
def f(x):
    x_view = np.array(x, copy=False)
    x_view[:] *= x_view  # modify memory without telling mx
    return x.sum()

x = mx.array([3.0])
y, df = mx.value_and_grad(f)(x)
print("f(x) = x² =", y.item())  # 9.0
print("f'(x) = 2x !=", df.item())  # 1.0
```

The function `f` indirectly modifies the array `x` through a memory view. However, this modification is not reflected in the gradient, as seen in the last line outputting `1.0`, representing the gradient of the sum operation alone. The squaring of `x` occurs externally to MLX, meaning that no gradient is incorporated.

It's important to note that a similar issue arises during array conversion and copying. For instance, a function defined as `mx.array(np.array(x)**2).sum()` would also result in an incorrect gradient, even though no in-place operations on MLX memory are executed.

## PyTorch

<Warning>
PyTorch support for `memoryview` is experimental and can break for multi-dimensional arrays. Casting to NumPy first is advised for now.
</Warning>

PyTorch supports the buffer protocol, but it requires an explicit `memoryview`:

```python
import mlx.core as mx
import torch

a = mx.arange(3)
b = torch.tensor(memoryview(a))
c = mx.array(b.numpy())
```

Conversion from PyTorch tensors back to arrays must be done via intermediate NumPy arrays with `numpy()`.

## JAX

JAX fully supports the buffer protocol:

```python
import mlx.core as mx
import jax.numpy as jnp

a = mx.arange(3)
b = jnp.array(a)
c = mx.array(b)
```

## TensorFlow

TensorFlow supports the buffer protocol, but it requires an explicit `memoryview`:

```python
import mlx.core as mx
import tensorflow as tf

a = mx.arange(3)
b = tf.constant(memoryview(a))
c = mx.array(b)
```
